            <h4>01 Project Overview</h4>
            <p>Barebone Swimwear is an Australian-based start-up swim and resort wear label. The brand is committed to designing elegant and timeless pieces that empower women while upholding ethical and sustainable production practices. With a focus on creating high-quality luxurious swimwear, Barebone Swim caters to millennial women seeking modernized yet classic designs. </p>

            <h4>02 Problems</h4>
            <p>The development of the Barebone Swim website presented several challenges. It was crucial to create a website that embodied the brand's core values while adhering to its established style guide. As a startup, Barebone Swim needed a site that facilitated a seamless checkout process, efficiently handled customer inquiries, featured intuitive product pages, and had a scalable architecture to support future growth. Integrating social proof and customer reviews was essential to build trust and credibility among potential buyers. Additionally, optimizing SEO was necessary to enhance the brand's visibility and drive organic traffic.</p>

            <h4>03 Solutions</h4>
            <p>To address these challenges, I designed a modern and minimalist website that reflects Barebone Swim's values while strictly adhering to the brand's style guide. The website was built on Shopify to leverage its e-commerce platform capabilities for scalability, including a one-page checkout to handle third-party payment gateways. I developed a user-friendly contact form that allows customers to categorize their inquiries easily for efficient handling and response. SEO best practices were implemented, including keyword optimization, meta tags, and alt tags to enhance visibility and drive organic traffic. Customer testimonials and reviews were incorporated on product pages to build trust and credibility. Additionally, I used accordions for additional information to ensure the main product details remained uncluttered and included high-quality images to showcase the products effectively.</p>

            <h4>04 Design Process</h4>
            <p>The project began with a comprehensive onboarding form and an initial meeting to understand the brand, its target audience,  goals, and desired website features. This was followed by extensive research, including a social media audit to deeply understand the company's identity and competitor research to identify areas for improvement and new features. Using the research findings, I was able to create a sitemap and low-fidelity wireframes to gather feedback on user experience. </p>

            <h4>05 User Research</h4>
            <p>To ensure the wireframe and sitemap met user needs and expectations, I conducted both qualitative and quantitative research methods. <br><br> Interviews: I conducted interviews with 12 individuals who will fit the target demographic for barebone swim.<br><br> Key questions include: <br> 
              • How easy was it to navigate and find the information you needed? <br>

              • What are your thoughts on the product information provided? 
              <br><br>Surveys: A survey was distributed to a larger audience to gather quantitative data on user satisfaction and usability.<br><br> Key metrics measured include:<br>
              • The visual appeal of the website on a scale of 1 to 5 <br>
              • Satisfaction with the information provided <br>
              • Likelihood of recommending the website to a friend on a  scale of 1 to 5 <br>
